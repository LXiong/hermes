### Features

#### ([#359](https://github.com/allegro/hermes/issues/359)) OAuth2 support [incubating]

Hermes supports Resource Owner Password Credential Grant scenario. It is possible to declare multiple OAuth providers
in Hermes, along with their credentials. Each subscription can choose a provider and defines own user & password.

### Enhancements

#### ([#556](https://github.com/allegro/hermes/pull/556)) Added source and target hostname information to tracking

Tracking information now contains additional fields: `hostname` and `remote_hostname`, which are:

* on Frontend side:
    * `hostname`: hostname of Frontend host that received the message
    * `remote_hostname`: IP address of events producer (who published)
* on Consumers side:
    * `hostname`: hostname of Consumer host that was handling the message
    * `remote_hostname`: IP address/hostname of host that acknowledged/rejected message (who received)

#### ([#561](https://github.com/allegro/hermes/pull/561)) Consumers process model improvements

Improving the stability of new internal Consumers process model by adding consumer process graceful shutdown
and filtering unwatned signals (i.e. sequential START & STOP) which might cause instability.

For monitoring purposes two new metrics (counters) were created in Consumers that compare the assignments state vs 
the actual consumers running:

* `consumers-workload.monitor.missing.count` - how many processes are missing compared to assigned amount
* `consumers-workload.monitor.oversubscribed.count` - how many processes exist although they should not, as this
    instance of Consumers is not assigned to run them

In addition to metrics, warning logs are emitted with details about subscription names missing/oversubscribed.

#### ([#563](https://github.com/allegro/hermes/pull/563)) Apache Curator 2.11.0 and Guava 19.0
